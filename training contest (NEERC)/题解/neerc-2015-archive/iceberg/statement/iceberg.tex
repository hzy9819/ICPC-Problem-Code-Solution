You are working for Metagonia stock exchange. Recently traders in Metagonia had heard about Iceberg orders
traded on London stock exchange and asked your employer to add such functionality as well.
A \emph{stock exchange} is an engine that receives \emph{orders} and generates \emph{trades}.

An \emph{iceberg order} is a quintuple of integers ($ID$, $T$, $P$, $V$, $TV$). 
Each order has an identifier $ID$ (unique among all orders), 
type $T$ (which is equal to either $BUY=1$ or $SELL=2$), 
price $P$, total remaining volume $V$ and tip volume $TV$. 
For each order, exchange additionally keeps track of its current volume $CV$ and priority $PR$.
There is also a global priority counter of the exchange $GP$.
An \emph{order book} of the exchange is a set of orders.

Trades that are generated by the exchange are quadruples of integers ($BUY\_ID$, $SELL\_ID$, $P$, $V$). 
Each trade has $BUY\_ID$ and $SELL\_ID$~--- identifiers of matching $BUY$ and $SELL$ orders, 
trade price $P$, and trade volume $V$.

When an order is received by the exchange it is matched against orders currently on the order book. 
This is done as follows. Suppose an order $a$ is received with
$T_a = SELL$. Among all orders currently on the order book we look for an order $b$ such that $T_b = BUY$ and
$P_b \geq P_a$. We select such an order $b$ with the largest price, and if there are several --- one with the smallest priority. 
If there is such an order $b$, then a trade $t$ is generated with $BUY\_ID_t = ID_b$ and $SELL\_ID_t = ID_a$
at trade price $P_t = P_b$ with trade volume $V_t = \min(V_a, CV_b)$. 
$V_a$, $V_b$, and $CV_b$ are all decreased by trade volume. If $V_b = 0$ after this, then the order $b$ is removed from the order book. 
If $CV_b=0$ (but $V_b > 0$) then we set current volume of order $b$ to 
$CV_b = \min(V_b, TV_b)$, set $PR_b = GP$, and increment $GP$. 
We continue these operations of selecting $b$ and generating trades until either $V_a = 0$ or
there are no more orders $b$ on the order book which satisfy the condition. In the latter case, we add order $a$ to the order book 
with $CV_a = \min(V_a, TV_a)$ and $PR_a = GP$, and then increment $GP$. When the process of matching the order $a$ is finished with 
several trades between the same pair of orders $a$ and $b$ (and there can be lots of them!), 
they are all united into a single trade with the volume equal to the sum of individual trade volumes.

If $T_a = BUY$ we are looking for an order $b$ with $T_b = SELL$ and $P_b \leq P_a$ and select such an order $b$ 
with the smallest price and the smallest priority among those. The rest of the matching process is as described above,
with trades having $BUY\_ID_t = ID_a$, $SELL\_ID_t = ID_b$, $P_t = P_b$, and $V_t = \min(V_a, CV_b)$.

Initially the order book is empty. You are presented with several orders that are received by the exchange one by one. You need
to print generated trades and the order book state after all orders are processed.

\textbf{Hint:} The priority and $GP$ are introduced in the problem statement only for the purpose of a formal description of the algorithm. 
The actual implementation does not have to keep track of priority. Typically, an exchange simply keeps a priority-ordered list of
orders of each type at each price in its order book.

\InputFile

The first line of the input contains the number of orders $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 50\,000$). Each of the following $n$ lines represent an order.
Each order is given by a space-separated quintuple $ID$ $T$ $P$ $V$ $TV$, 
where $1 \leq ID \leq 1\,000\,000$, $T = 1$ for $BUY$ and $T = 2$ for $SELL$,
$1 \leq P \leq 100\,000$ and $1 \leq TV \leq V \leq 1\,000\,000\,000$.

\OutputFile

For each order print all trades generated by processing this order, in ascending order of pairs ($BUY\_ID$, $SELL\_ID$),
each trade on its own line.
Each trade shall be printed as a space-separated quadruple of integers
$BUY\_ID$ $SELL\_ID$ $P$ $V$. It is guaranteed that the total number of trades would not exceed $100\,000$.
Print a blank line after all trades, followed by the order book. Each order that is still on the book shall be printed 
as a space-separated \textbf{sextuple} $ID$ $T$ $P$ $V$ $TV$ $CV$, sorted first by $P$ and then by $PR$.

\Example

\begin{example}
\exmp{

42 1 100 200 20
239 1 100 50 50
1111 1 101 30 15

}%
\end{example}

In the sample input the first four orders have $T = BUY$. Assuming that at the beginning $GP$ at the exchange was equal to $1$, 
after receiving these orders the order book looks in the following way when ordered according to the matching rules from the problem
statement for $T_b=BUY$ orders (first by the largest price, then by the smallest priority): 

\begin{tabular}{| r r r r r r | r |} 
\hline
$ID$ & $T$ & $P$ & $V$ & $TV$ & $CV$ & $PR$ \\ \hline
1111 & 1 & 101 &  30 & 15 & 15 & 3 \\ \hline
  42 & 1 & 100 & 200 & 20 & 20 & 1 \\
 239 & 1 & 100 &  50 & 50 & 50 & 2 \\
1234 & 1 & 100 & 300 & 15 & 15 & 4 \\ 
\hline
\end{tabular}

The fifth order (with $ID_a=4321$) has $T_a = SELL$, $P_a = 99$, and $V_a=125$ and is eligible for match with all of the above four
orders given in the above table. First, it matches twice with the order $1111$ with the highest price of $101$ 
for a total trade volume of $30$, removes it from the order book, bumps $GP$ to $6$ in the process, and decreases $V_a$ to $95$.
Then, there are three other orders at price $100$. One matching pass through them produces three trades for a total volume of $85$
(volume $20$ with order $42$, volume $50$ with order $239$, removes it from the book, volume $15$ with order $1234$), bumps 
$GP$ to $8$, and decreases $V_a$ to $10$. The remaining orders in the book are shown below:

\begin{tabular}{| r r r r r r | r |} 
\hline
$ID$ & $T$ & $P$ & $V$ & $TV$ & $CV$ & $PR$ \\ \hline
  42 & 1 & 100 & 180 & 20 & 20 & 6 \\
1234 & 1 & 100 & 275 & 15 & 15 & 7 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

One last match with the order $42$ produces a trade with a volume of $10$ (for a total volume of $30$ for matches with order $42$)
and the order $4321$ is done ($V_a=0$). Four corresponding total trades for order $4321$ are printed in the
sample output. The remaining order book is:

\begin{tabular}{| r r r r r r | r |} 
\hline
$ID$ & $T$ & $P$ & $V$ & $TV$ & $CV$ & $PR$ \\ \hline
  42 & 1 & 100 & 180 & 20 & 10 & 6 \\
1234 & 1 & 100 & 275 & 15 & 15 & 7 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The sixth $BUY$ order (with $ID=5678$) is added to the order book ($GP$ becomes $9$):

\begin{tabular}{| r r r r r r | r |} 
\hline
$ID$ & $T$ & $P$ & $V$ & $TV$ & $CV$ & $PR$ \\ \hline
5678 & 1 & 101 &  30 & 30 & 30 & 8 \\ \hline
  42 & 1 & 100 & 180 & 20 & 10 & 6 \\
1234 & 1 & 100 & 275 & 15 & 15 & 7 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

The last, seventh order (with $ID=8765$), can be matched only with the order $5678$ due to price condition, generates a trade
with volume of $30$, order $5678$ is removed from the order book, while order $8765$ is added. 
Now the order book has both $BUY$ and $SELL$ orders:

\begin{tabular}{| r r r r r r | r |} 
\hline
$ID$ & $T$ & $P$ & $V$ & $TV$ & $CV$ & $PR$ \\ \hline
  42 & 1 & 100 & 180 & 20 & 10 & 6 \\
1234 & 1 & 100 & 275 & 15 & 15 & 7 \\ \hline
8765 & 2 & 101 &  70 & 20 & 20 & 9 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{problem}
